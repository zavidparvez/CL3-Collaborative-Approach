X-ray Image Classification with Transfer Learning, Federated Learning, and Incremental Learning
This repository provides an implementation of X-ray image classification using a combination of Transfer Learning, Federated Learning, and Incremental Learning to address Concept Drift. The project focuses on applying federated learning techniques across multiple clients (e.g., hospitals or institutions) using pre-trained models to minimize the need for sharing sensitive data, while also adapting to changing data patterns over time.

Project Overview
This project applies state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to classify X-ray images in a distributed learning environment. By leveraging transfer learning from pre-trained models like EfficientNet and federating the learning process across multiple clients, the system avoids direct data sharing and instead aggregates learning updates. Furthermore, incremental learning is employed to adapt to Concept Drift — changes in data distributions over time — to ensure continuous model improvement.

Key Components:

Transfer Learning: Fine-tune a pre-trained model (EfficientNet) to perform X-ray classification.
Federated Learning: Distribute the learning process across five clients, aggregating weights to create a global model.
Incremental Learning with Concept Drift Detection: Update the model dynamically in response to changes in data distribution.

Installation
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
EfficientNet
Install the required Python packages by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
Add X-ray image datasets for each client under the data/ directory (e.g., data/client_1/, data/client_2/).
Each client directory should contain subdirectories for each class of images.
Example:

bash
Copy code
data/client_1/
  ├── class_0/
  ├── class_1/
Running Experiments
Federated Learning Experiment
To run the federated learning experiment, navigate to the experiments/ directory and open the Federated Learning Notebook:

bash
Copy code
cd experiments/
jupyter notebook federated_learning_xray.ipynb
The notebook will guide you through setting up the federated learning process, distributing model training across five clients.

Transfer Learning Experiment
For a transfer learning experiment using pre-trained models:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook transfer_learning_xray.ipynb
This notebook fine-tunes a pre-trained EfficientNet model on the X-ray dataset.

Incremental Learning with Concept Drift Detection
Run the incremental learning experiment:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook incremental_learning_xray.ipynb
This notebook simulates the detection of concept drift during model updates and adapts the model accordingly.

Model Descriptions
Transfer Learning
The Transfer Learning Model uses EfficientNet as the base model, which is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. This model is fine-tuned to classify X-ray images by adding dense layers and a softmax output layer for classification.

Model Code: See models/transfer_model.py.
Usage: Efficient for feature extraction and quick adaptation to X-ray data.
Federated Learning
The Federated Learning Module simulates a scenario where multiple clients (e.g., hospitals) collaboratively train a global model without sharing their private data. The model weights from each client are averaged at the end of each communication round.

Model Code: See models/federated_learning.py.
Usage: Useful for privacy-preserving learning across institutions.
Incremental Learning and Concept Drift
In Incremental Learning, the model continuously learns from new data over time while retaining previously learned information. Concept Drift occurs when the data distribution shifts; the system detects this drift and updates the model accordingly.

Model Code: See models/incremental_learning.py.
Usage: Effective for environments where the data evolves over time (e.g., new patient data).
