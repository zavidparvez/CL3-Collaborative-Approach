# Transfer Learning, Federated Learning, and Incremental Learning with Concept Drift Using X-ray Images

This project implements Transfer Learning, Federated Learning, and Incremental Learning techniques with a focus on Concept Drift using X-ray image datasets. The goal is to incrementally improve a model using federated data from multiple clients without centralizing the data, which is crucial for privacy-sensitive applications such as medical imaging.
